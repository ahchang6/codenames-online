			Welcome to Codenames online!<br>
			<div class="dhead">
			In this page, I am going to guide you through what Codenames is and how to use this website to play it
			</div>
			<br>
			What is Codenames?
			<br>
			<div class="dhead">
				Codenames is a game created in 2015 by Vlaada Chv√°til. The objective of the games is, through the two spymasters designated for each team, to select all the words that belongs to your team before the opposing team does, and without selecting the assassin word.
			</div>
			<br>
			What are the specific rules?
			<div class="dhead">
				Check out the official rulebook:
				<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/119841/codenames-rulebook-english" download>Rulebook</a>
			</div>
			<br>
			Now that I know how to play, how do I use this website?
			<div class="dhead">
				To start, simply click on Create Room to generate a room with our list of words. The access code will then display, copy and distribute the access code to anyone who wants to join the room. Clicking join room with the access code will take you to the room where you can choose your team. Choosing your team then takes you to the game. The players will the wait for the players to choose the word for the corresponding team.
			</div>
			<br>
			It seems cool, but I want to use my own words to play!
			<div class="dhead">
				You can do that! On the main page, if you upload a text document with each word on a newline, our server will create a game with all your words in the game, and if there's more than 25, we will use your text document as the word bank instead of ours!
